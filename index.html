								<p>By the time human society first stepped into the 21st century. The significance of the application of big data continues to increase in practical life. Algorithms-based big data exploit a new channel of reallocation resources while maintaining the social stability of the economies. In this particular field, the United States and China take the leading roles in several Internet-based companies, which have the best access to numerous databases. Based on this precise technology, personal services are supported by customers’ own purchase histories, and it generates an excellent opportunity for firms to advertising, servicing, and risk controlling. However, aiming to maximize those tech giants’ profits, they utilize the technology for price discrimination purpose. Additionally, some financial institutions attempt to manipulate the market and share their risks with the economy. The following article, with the above content being mentioned, will also explain the importance of market surveillance on big data and the role of government in balancing the market and the network sovereignty. This article is mainly divided into five parts: <a href="#deve">the development of big data</a>, <a href="#netw">network sovereignty</a>, <a href="#merits">merits of the application of big data</a>, <a href="#Manip">manipulations</a> and <a href="#gova">government surveillance</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Development of Big Data</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>At the beginning of the 2010s, various governments found the significance of big data, enhancing their economic growth and increasing international trading competitiveness. Undoubtedly, well-funded developed countries take the initiative to publish significant data related legislation and invest more government budget in this field.</p>
								<p>In January 2013, the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced that it would inject £600 million into the development of eight categories of high and new technologies, of which nearly 40% of the budget (£189 million) was invested in big data (Big data standardization white paper, 2020). In 2011, the National Science and Technology Council of the United States established a group called Big Data Senior Steering Group, which aimed at determining the current developing goal in big data technology. The same year, France launched a project named “Open Data Proxima Mobile”, which was trying to promote the appliance of public data on personal mobile devices. In 2012, the world’s first Open Data Institute established under the assistance of the British Government. Afterwards, the Japanese government announced its plan in big data technology.</p>
								<p>China and the United States hitherto pick up the leading role in the development of big data due to several Internet-based huge companies, such as Alibaba, Tencent in China and Amazon, Google in America. Those companies are e-commerce providers who hold vast platforms providing online services to global individuals. Thus, they have the best direct access to the database to develop their analytical techniques, which support the computation of the big data.</p>
								<p>Those tech giants have also come up with their cloud computing, which predominantly offers support on data storage and computing power without frequent supervision, such as Aliyun ran by the Alibaba Group, JDCloud ran by the JD Group, Amazon Web Services(AWS) ran by Amazon and Google Cloud Platform(GCP) offered by Google.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Network Sovereignty</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Under a globalizing world context, it is significant for every country to have its own data storage and platform companies to preserve its network sovereignty. For instance, Amazon is the most frequent used e-commerce platform in Europe, which means that numerous European user data are sending back to a foreign company every second. In other words, the United States can analyze the social pattern of Europe, whereas the European countries even do not have an equivalent amount of data compared with America. Accordingly, the gap in international competitiveness can only get wider. Developing big data could help the domestic government to understand their citizens better, thus, benefiting the formulation of economic policies. Apart from that, during the possible “wartime” that the war could be any form, holding your opponent’s information would play an important role.</p>
								<p>The idea of China’s “Internet sovereignty” was first rolled out in a 2010 white paper called “The Internet in China” (Tiezzi, 2014). The state conserves and governs all the information flowing into and within the borders. China’s Internet sovereignty has some characteristics that differed from other countries and seems to be more strict. Evan Osnos (2010) mentioned that the Internet is more like a free speech presented platform in other countries, and China’s Internet practices create trade barriers for many multinational companies. He claimed that it would limit the advertising channel for the foreign exporters who are willing to market their products in mainland China. Although it might partly discourage international commercial activity, better social stabilization could be achieved by the Chinese government by filtering radical and misleading comments published on social media.</p>

							<article id="merits">
								<h2 class="major">Merits of the Application of Big Data</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Data technology will fuel the consumption of the citizens and ameliorate the market resources allocation within the modern economy. Before the Internet's invention, sellers are primarily based on media like the radio and television to find potential buyers. Through the implementation of big data algorithms in e-commerce platforms —— like Taobao, JD and PDD, which are three well-known platforms offering online shopping services in China—— the original time and cost needed for producers seeking target consumers are shrunk. Take PDD as an example, and it has a consumer-to-manufacturer(C2M) business model that aims to save the price increase earned by middlemen during commodity transactions. With big data, upstream factories can design and produce in-demand products based on a large amount of application users’ preference data. This operating way, in turn, “compressing the new product development process by 50%,” which can successfully suit the latest market trend and consumer demand (Digitizing the supply chain, 2020). The utilization of big data cripple the information asymmetry in the market; hence the allocation of resources based on market demand and supply improved significantly.</p>
								<p>Moreover, big data expands the breadth and depth of the Internet economy. They provide personalized services based on the data collected from the users and can be utilized to analyze their consumption patterns and characteristics, which could offer an excellent opportunity for firms to advertising, servicing and risk controlling precisely. Taobao’s customer-to-customer(C2C) model is worth mentioning, allowing consumers to trade with each other in an online environment (Traver, 2020). Meanwhile, a specific algorithm is used by Taobao to divide different types of customers into several groups which have distinct purchase preferences. After collecting this data, the platform will automatically assist the existing online merchants in targeting advertising, which recommends various products to their potential buyers based on their past purchasing records. This business model has proved its effectiveness by astonishing results. The December Quarter 2020 Results published by the Alibaba Group mentioned that the annual active clients of Taobao reached 779 million by the end of 2020 (Alibaba Group Announces December Quarter 2020 Results, 2021). Accordingly, it prevents invalid marketing and raises operating efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

							<article id="Manip">
								<h2 class="major">Manipulations</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Undoubtedly, every coin has two sides, and big data is no exception. Several e-commerce platforms use algorithms to price-discriminate their customers, which result in the existence of different pricing for one same product in various accounts based on their consumption level determined by purchasing histories. This price discrimination could effectively reduce consumer surplus, hence benefits producers. It will also create unfairness for those traditional peddlers, who still occupy a considerable proportion of Chinese economic activity and do not have the technical tools to manipulate the pricing. Nevertheless, it harms consumers own rights when it limits consumers’ choices and generates disparities. A healthy market should provide sufficient information for both producers and consumers, and trade is a two-way selection. Under such a marketing strategy, it has yet offered lacks of details to clients, which disrupts market equilibrium to some extent.</p>
								<p>Gillis and Spiess (2019) pointed out that though automated pricing increases transparency, the internal complexity also imposes restrictions on applying existing law. On January 7th, 2021, China Consumers Association(CCA) has convened a Symposium on Algorithmic Regulation and Consumer Protection in the Field of Online Consumption in Beijing, which underlined that those algorithms could subsequently influence the purchasing decisions of customers. If the authorities just leave matters to develop themselves, it will go against the fair competition in the market and make consumers squeezed by the technology. Therefore, the CCA pressured the Chinese legislative body to promulgate related laws as soon as possible.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Government surveillance</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/data6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Chinese government has started its surveillance and intervention on tech giants supported by big data. The IPO failure of the Ant Group, which is the most prominent scientific and technological finance firm world-wide, strongly proved that.</p>
								<p>The core of finance is risk controlling, which data can back up. In other words, it saves the effort needed to determine the customer's credit rating, utilizing the big data offered by owned platforms like Taobao, Alipay, and Amap. The Ant Group, distinguished from other similar companies, is countless consumer data provided by the whole consumption system supported by the Alibaba Group. The Ant  Financial Services Group(AFSG), owned by the Ant Group, overcame the risk managing problems unsolvable by the traditional financial industries like commercial banks and maintained its bad debt rate of around 1%.</p>
								<p>Despite its striking operating achievements, the AFSG’s profit model demonstrated by them during the pre-IPO process attracted the authorities’ attention. As a financial institution, its profit model's nature has no difference compared to the traditional banking system, relying on the interest margin. Unlike commercial banks, the AFSG does not find a department aiming to attract public saving, which means they lack the original capital to start lending.</p>
								<p>High leverage assists it to circumvent conventional capital accumulation and boost its returns in the short term. Wearing this to a real-life model, the AFSG could use its existed funds, for example, 3 billion yuan, and double the leverage. Therefore, it now has 9 billion yuan to spend on the first round of lending process faced to the public. Equivalently, it will receive valued creditor’s rights. Afterwards, they choose to let those rights undergo asset-backed security(ABS), a phrase that played a crucial role in the subprime crisis in 2008, making its lending continuously funded by the citizens and commercial banks who buy its financial products which went through the course of ABS. Among the sales of all the ABS products, 95% of them, which contain low risks, are purchased by the ordinary citizens, while the 5% remainders are digested by the other branch offices of the Alibaba Group through the cross-buy transaction. This operation strategy keeps adding leverage on the inventive 3 billion capital, eventually reached a scale of over 300 billion. High leverage always equals abnormal risks.</p>
								<p>Operating with unreasonable money reserves significantly influence the sustainable development and risk-controlled ability of the firm. If once it fails to keep running the business, the majority of the loss would be bored by the consumers in the market, and the whole Chinese banking system, on account of the owned capital of the AFSG, cannot cover the tremendous money lost in transaction circle. Predictably, the structural economic crisis brought by it would wound not only the Chinese economy but also the globe, and this time it could be even worse than the subprime crisis. Therefore, the government stepped in and halted its IPO in order to eliminate potential future market unbalance.</p>

						<!-- future -->
						    <article id="future">
								<h2 class="major">Future work</h2>
								<p>There are some ideas that I would have liked to exploit in the future study, and they could be tested or followed:</p>
								    <p>1. A model could be created and ran to examine whether the overall consumption efficiency of the market will be improved when the consumers suffered from artificial intelligence’s manipulation in the long term. Consumers may spend more time comparing prices of the same product over the Internet, hence increasing the inefficiency.</p>
								    <p>2. Problems related to big data currently left unsolved, especially the government legislation on market surveillance and antitrust action, would be closely followed up by me. By comparing different Chinese government and foreign governments' policies, evaluations can be made while decoding the veiled correlation and causation.</p>
						    </article>

						<!-- conclu -->
						    <article id="conclu">
								<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/universe.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Plenty of countries have seen the future of big data, hence invested a considerable amount of government budget into this field. It offers an extraordinary opportunity for reformation for the active participants in the market, such as advertising on manufactural merchants, servicing on e-platforms providers and risk controlling on financial industries. As the advantages received by employed this tool standing out, some troubles have also emerged. Some titanic firms, which gained monopoly positions in the economy, are conducting price discrimination and speculation. These have profoundly affected the rights and interests of the consumers and market equity. The government of China is looking for a justified position while improving efficiency as a whole. Some associations and organizations have already closely watched the market and communicated with relevant authorities to reduce information failure. A tradeoff must be achieved by coordinating the central and private firms and promulgating laws to standardize market behaviours. Optimistically, the Chinese economy still has enormous potential to develop different big data technology, primarily due to two reasons: immense population and diversified industries. The former provides a robust database benefiting the development of the more precise algorithm, and the latter leaves more opportunities to upgrade industries through the participation of big data.</p>
